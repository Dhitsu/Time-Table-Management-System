# Time-Table-Management-System
The Time Table Management System is a crucial university project developed in C, designed to efficiently create a clash-free timetable for the required number of classes and professor allotments. This system streamlines the complex task of scheduling by automating the process, saving time and effort for the university staff.

Using the Time Table Management System, administrators can input various constraints, such as available classrooms, professors' availability, subjects, and their respective time slots. The system then intelligently analyzes these constraints and generates an optimized timetable that maximizes resource utilization and minimizes conflicts.

With its user-friendly interface, the system allows for easy input and modification of data, enabling quick adjustments if necessary. Additionally, it provides real-time clash detection, ensuring that no overlapping classes or professor allotments occur.

The Time Table Management System in C is a powerful tool that enhances the productivity and organization of universities, creating a well-structured timetable that meets the institution's requirements while effectively managing resources. Its ability to handle complex scheduling tasks and deliver efficient solutions makes it an invaluable asset for any educationalÂ institution.
